# Jyoti Client Application

The repository contains the client application that serves at a user's system. Through this application, people with multiple  disorders (**visual impairment**, **dumbness** or **both**) can receive elementary education and general knowledge.

## Prerequisites

The Jyoti Client Application uses :
+ Maven Java (for building GUI and basic processing)
+ Python (for Machine learning and Object detection)
  + OpenCV (Object detection)
+ Android (for implementing some features like Gson, which isn't available on Maven)
+ IBM Cognitive Services (Watson: text-to-speech SDK)
+ Firebase services used :
  + Firebase Realtime Database (storing test-scores of users)
  + Firebase Admin SDK
  + Firebase Auth (Authenticating into the client platform)


## Installation and running

First, **clone** the repository using command :
`git clone https://github.com/Biswajee/JyotiService.git`

Make sure you are running **JAVA 8** on your system. If not, head over to install the right one for yourself [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Install **Android SDK** in your system. This will be required since the application uses certain functionalities available with _android java_ but not in _maven java_.

If you are done, you need to have **python 3.6** installed now and set as your default python program in your environment variable of your system.

Wait, there is still a few more things to do with your newly installed python:

+ Make sure you have pip installed along with python
+ Install the following python libraries using `pip`
  + cv2
  + pyaudio
  + numpy
  + copy

Once you have them installed, perform this:
`pip install --upgrade "watson-developer-cloud>=2.4.1"`

For more information on watson-developer-cloud sdk, head [here](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk).


Kudos, you are close to deployment now !!!  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Run the sample `Jyoti.jar` supplied in the repository to make sure you are heading the right track.

Incase, you notice erroneous behaviour, start your terminal in the repository directory and type : `java -jar Jyoti.jar`.

Please create an _**issue**_ incase you find errors during running. The application requires internet connectivity, so make sure you are online while you start the application.

Well, I am sure now you wish to build it all from source and run it. But you need a few more steps now.

If you try to compile the project now, you will definitely fail. ðŸ¤£

That being said, let's look for a solution:

The Application uses API from **NewsAPI.org**. So, get one, its free.
Also set up your **IBM Bluemix account** and create a text-to speech resource. Then get the credentials from there.

Now, you need to create a **Keydata.java** file under directory `src/main/java/com/mycompany/jyotimaven`.

Paste this piece of code inside **Keydata.java**:
```
package com.mycompany.jyotimaven;

public class Keydata {

  public static String NEWS_API_KEY = "";
  public static String BLUEMIX_KEY = "";
}
```

I'm glad to tell you, I appreciate your patience ! ðŸ˜Š

If you are a maven guy, you must have already seen it in **pom.xml**:

```
<dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.firebase</groupId>
            <artifactId>firebase-admin</artifactId>
            <version>6.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

We need to configure, firebase-admin sdk now. Head [here](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-java) and [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) to know how to do it.

More simply, do as directed below :

### Add Firebase to your app

To use the Firebase Admin SDKs, you'll need a **Firebase project**, a **service account** to communicate with the Firebase service, and a **configuration file** with your _service account's credentials_.

If you don't already have a Firebase project, add one in the **Firebase console**. The Add project dialog also gives you the option to add Firebase to an existing **Google Cloud Platform project**.

Navigate to the **Service Accounts** tab in your **project's settings page**.

Click the **Generate New Private Key** button at the bottom of the Firebase Admin SDK section of the Service Accounts tab.

After you click the button, a **JSON file** containing your service account's credentials will be downloaded.

### Gotcha ! This might bite you
```
<dependency>
            <groupId>com.android.support</groupId>
            <artifactId>appcompat-v7</artifactId>
            <version>27.1.1</version>
            <scope>system</scope>
            <systemPath>G:/Androidsdk/platform-tools/extras/android/m2repository/com/android/support/appcompat-v7/25.3.1/appcompat-v7-25.3.1-sources.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

Set the path accordingly with your _android sdk_. You may have to download the `platform-tools` if required.

Once, you are done. Give yourself a highfive ! You are all set to build the application. Incase, you are running **Netbeans**, do a `clean build` on the project. Now, the resources will get downloaded to your system.

Once completed, you'll have a target folder in your source repository. Pull up the jar that says`...-with-dependencies to the root folder` and run it.

You will need to create your own `audio/` and `images/` directory to provide some necessary resources now.
